                <li>1 napa cabbage leaf</li>
                <li>1 long green onion</li>
                <li>4 shiitake mushrooms</li>
                <li>100g enoki mushrooms</li>
                <li>100g pan fried tofu</li>
                <li>100g konnyaku noodles</li>
                <li>2-4 eggs</li>
                <li>100ml sake</li>
                <li>50ml mirin</li>
                <li>50ml soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, let's make the sukiyaki sauce also known as Warishita. In a pot, combine the sake, mirin, soy sauce and sugar. Adding the sake makes the beef more delicious. Mirin is similar to sake but it has more flavor and sweetness.</li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a boil and simmer it for a while to let the alcohol evaporate completely. Now, the sauce is ready.</li>
                <li>Cut the beef slices in half.</li>
                <li>Cut out the firm white part from the napa cabbage leaves. Thinly slice the white part using diagonal cuts. Cut the leafy part into smaller pieces.</li>
                <li>Remove the stem of the shiitake mushroom. Carve a star-shaped pattern on the caps of the shiitake.</li>
                <li>Slice the yaki dofu, grilled firm tofu into bite-size pieces.</li>
                <li>Slice the long green onion also known as naganegi using diagonal cuts. </li>
                <li>Parboil the ito konnyaku or shirataki noodles and strain them thoroughly. Then, cut into smaller pieces.</li>
                <li>Now, all the preparations are finished. Let's make the sukiyaki.</li>
                <li>First, sautee the beef slices in a pan. Then, ladle the sukiyaki sauce over the beef.</li>
                <li>Next, add the napa cabbage leaves, yaki dofu, grilled firm tofu and ito konnyaku. Then, add the enoki mushrooms and long green onion. </li>
                <li>Pour additional sukiyaki sauce over the vegetables. You can adjust the amount of sukiyaki sauce as you test it. Cover with a lid and simmer for a couple of more minutes. Now, the sukiyaki is ready. </li>
            </ol>
